1
00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:02,366
hi everybody my name is Tom Hoot

2
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:04,966
principal trumpet of the Los Angeles Philharmonic

3
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:06,066
Today I am

4
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:08,533
extremely excited to share with you a new invention

5
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:09,866
a new resource

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,766
a new tool for brass players

7
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:13,600
it's called the ambashore

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,200
you know one of the problems with brass

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,566
playing is that so much of what's happening to make it

10
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:20,600
possible to play a brass instrument

11
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:22,900
is happening in areas we can't see

12
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:25,733
so I invented the ambusher for myself

13
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,766
to help with areas like stamina

14
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:30,333
response endurance flexibility

15
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,733
core of sound range

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,700
so let's dig in

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,933
I'm going to tell you all about this

18
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,166
in the following video

19
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,966
and in case you haven't figured it out yet

20
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,700
the reason it's called ambashure

21
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,800
is not because I'm trying to respell the word

22
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,000
it's because I want to talk about the ambashure

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,066
and I want to bring a degree of security

24
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:47,766
to you and your bras playing

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,933
maybe you've heard about balance

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,700
maybe some teachers talk to you about

27
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,366
balance in your trumpet playing

28
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:54,933
this is one elusive word

29
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:56,766
when it comes to playing a brass instrument

30
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,333
this device will help bring

31
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,766
sensitivity and nuance and awareness

32
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:02,266
to things like balance

33
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:04,400
we want to create a healthy read

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,166
and I'll explain this later in the video

35
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,200
I created the embosure for several reasons

36
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,466
first of which is my own curiosity

37
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,800
as a developing players still to this day

38
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,566
I want to find

39
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:16,733
new distinctions of how I can make music more

40
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,566
efficiently and with more fun

41
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,533
secondly was for my students

42
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,200
I want to help them find new distinctions in these same

43
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,133
areas and sometimes

44
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,133
giving them the same

45
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:29,533
sensation that I feel can be a real challenge

46
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,533
so this tool is going to help them with that

47
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,400
and thirdly as a young player

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,500
I really had serious limitations to what I could do

49
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,333
and it was really frustrating

50
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,000
things like range and endurance and power

51
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:46,000
stamina flexibility color core of sound

52
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,133
consistency from day to day

53
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,600
my days felt up and down and up and down

54
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,566
and I would try to sometimes plan

55
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:54,900
my concerts on the days that I felt good

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
so whether you're a student a beginner

57
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,466
a teacher or a professional

58
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,566
we all want to find

59
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:02,200
ease in our brass playing

60
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
and put the work in the right place

61
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,100
so that

62
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,066
ultimately you have access to making great music

63
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,366
with no limits

64
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,800
so let's get started

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,766
the first component that I want to share with you

66
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,533
is the standard visualizer

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,966
in your armature it will come assembled like this

68
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,200
you simply unscrew this portion

69
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:22,666
and now you have a traditional visualizer

70
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,600
which will come with a 7 rim

71
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,766
for beginners and some piccolo work

72
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,933
a 3 for sort of

73
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:30,500
middle of the road sized mouthpiece

74
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,866
and a 1.5 for those of you that play a slightly bigger

75
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:34,766
mouthpiece

76
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,100
today we're not going to get into too many details

77
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,666
but I want to bring awareness to what

78
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,400
each component is created

79
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,866
for the visualizer will basically help

80
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:44,900
bring awareness to what's happening inside the

81
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,733
rim from a visual standpoint

82
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,766
in later videos I will talk about what to look for

83
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,333
what to look out for and what to aim for

84
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:53,666
the second component

85
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,933
I want to share with you is the aperture setter

86
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,566
the aperture setter goes inside your visualizer

87
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,900
a nice firm tightening here

88
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,466
the point of the aperture setter

89
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:07,966
is to bring focus and sensitivity to your read

90
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,066
as a brass player

91
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:11,666
the reason that I created the aperture setter

92
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,800
is to help balance out the first tool

93
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,566
for years I used the visualizer

94
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:18,966
but only to find out that it got me spread

95
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,900
and with a big diffuse sound

96
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,200
the aperture setter

97
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,300
is a prerequisite for using the visualizer

98
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,600
and the third part of the ambashore

99
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,966
is the conditioning and coordination tool

100
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,333
now what do I mean by that

101
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:34,066
you know in trumpa playing and brass playing

102
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,366
there's a lot of fairly simple things to do

103
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,800
the problem is we have to do them all at the same time

104
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,366
if I ask you to blow an Airstream that's simple

105
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:42,266
if I ask you to

106
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,800
form an ambusher that's fairly simple

107
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,133
move your fingers a certain way

108
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,766
the problem is we have to do all these

109
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,066
things at the same time

110
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,766
the conditioning and coordination tool

111
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,900
helps us do two things at the same time

112
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,066
these two things are

113
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,100
engaging the Embousure

114
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,366
and blowing with a free relaxed Airstream

115
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,800
here we are talking about balance again

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,100
but the conditioning and coordination tool will help us

117
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,300
engage the Embousure while blowing at the same time

118
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,933
ultimately I invented the ambashore

119
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,000
to go against an idea

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,533
that has been

121
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,566
pervasive in the brass community for years

122
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,266
and this is don't think about your chops

123
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,566
well what if I told an OBO player

124
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:33,066
don't think about your reads

125
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,000
they would laugh me off the stage

126
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,700
of course

127
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,966
OBO players spend about half of their time creating

128
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,333
optimal beautiful reads

129
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,966
if they know what they sound like

130
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,333
even from a squawk

131
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,600
they can identify

132
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,366
good qualities or bad qualities within a read

133
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,000
ultimately my goal of the ambashure

134
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,400
is to have it be a resource or tool to

135
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,733
bring sensitivity

136
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,000
to how the sound actually happens

137
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,966
okay so let's recap the ambashure

138
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,533
we've got the visualizer with three different rims

139
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,366
we've got the aperture setter

140
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,700
and the coordination and conditioning tool

141
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,400
here in this video

142
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:10,600
you might be wondering

143
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,533
how do I use these things

144
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:14,766
don't worry subscribe to my YouTube channel

145
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:18,100
I have many tutorials that go in specific details

146
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,133
and I'll do the exercise with you

147
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,666
I've created a bunch of backing tracks that will help

148
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,966
you find what's the most natural setup

149
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,133
and work from there

150
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,866
so thanks for watching

151
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:30,066
I hope you're as excited about this as I am

152
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,500
it's a game changer for me in my own playing

153
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,266
and I hope it will be for you too
